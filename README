This module contains code to aid cross-platform (win32 and posix) development
in python. In general, python's standard library is designed to be
cross-platform, but there are several areas (file locking, inter-process
communication, etc.) where it is lacking.

To install this module, copy or symlink the cross_platform directory into
your python path.
